2015-10-07 16:18:59	idiot	This is going to stound stupid but I am stupid so it does not matter. Is there a way to make a calendar for a 4x6 index card? the calendars I found on Office Word and Excel orl too big to print on the 4X6 index card. Just looking for a monthly calendar. The month can be split in half if it has to be. I am just looking for something that has the whole month on one or two 4x6 cards not 10.
