2015-10-07 16:18:30	idiot	This is going to stound stupid but I am stupid so it does not matter. Is there a way to make a calendar for a 4x6 index card? the calendars I found on Office Word and Excel orl too big to print on the 4X6 index card. Just looking for a monthly calendar. The month can be split in half if it has to be. I am just looking for something that has the whole month on one or two 4x6 cards not 10.

2015-10-07 16:26:17	ReAn	... im still really confused by this. Utawarerumono, 2nd season so many years later O.o I'd have to dig up the original and watch it again because... i've literally forgotten everything
2015-10-07 16:26:55	shinobu_	ReAn: is it good?
2015-10-07 16:27:55	ReAn	Uh, the original series probably wouldn't hold up to today's standards as well as it did back then. It was not your typical cookie cutter show though.
2015-10-07 16:29:47	ReAn	If i remember correctly it started out pretty simple and got dark near the end.
2015-10-07 16:31:25	ReAn	I'd leave you with a trailer link, but it was done by ADV in thier weird days...
2015-10-07 16:33:11	ReAn	sorry shinobu_, I Can't see anything really exciting from the listings. I'll have to actually watch stuff to reccomend anything.
